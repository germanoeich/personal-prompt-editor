Example prompt:

Let's assume that:
block with id = 1 is a preset block that defines the tone of the LLM, with the following prompt: Be direct, concise, keep your replies short and objetive.
block with id = 12 is a block that tells the model to output in some json format
```
<block id=1 />

Please look for any grammar mistakes in this text:

// Here would be some text for the LLM to analyze (not a preset)

<block id=12 />
```

In the UI, I expect it to look like

[Tone preset block] - Displays the block content, name, etc 
[One off block] - Text content (Please look for any grammar mistakes in this text:)
[Output preset block] - Output block
(+ icon to add a new one off block)


One of blocks are not persisted block entities, its part of the prompt. We'll only render it as a block to keep consistency, nothing more.

All blocks are editable inline, including preset ones. We'll use a override system, where we keep the reference to the original block, but override the content:

```
<block id=1>This is a prompt override, we can also use {{originalText}} to append the original block text to our override</block>

Some more text
```

In this instance, we would see a clear indication that the block is being overriding and show a reset and a save button for the preset.
